# Simple FireChat

This is a very simple chat app mainly written to have a go to Angular using FireBase 
real-time data service as backend. Basically a playground that wanted to share as 
it might be of use to someone. Any comments or suggestions are more than welcomed. 
These are some of the explored ideas:

*Test and learn FireBase technology
**data synchronisation
**user authentication
**database schema and permissions
*Refactoring and extension of angularFire-seed to be used as foundation for a chat app.
**Content loader
**Content update animations
*Quick skinning using boilerplate with colour schema changed and layout amends:
**Use of display:table instead of floats for main layout.
**Fixed menu: always visible.
